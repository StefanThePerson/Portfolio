          My name is Michael Kornakiewicz and I was a student at Changemaker Educations
          where I learned to become a Web Developer in E-commerce.
          <br>
          <br>
          I have learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and MySQL. For these I have also 
          learned about UX & UI to better understand the interplay between customer, visitor
          & owner.
          Additionally, I am educated in digital marketing and project methodology so that
          I am able to work in an agile fashion.
          <br>
          <br>
          In my freetime I enjoy writing, hanging out with friends, workout and
          play boardgames or PC games.
          I am also a hobbyist where I collect and paint plastic models.

          A group-project I had for school.
          The idea was to create a website where those looking to get better at a
          game could book time with a coach to teach them.
          The site isn't live and is purely a proof of concept.

          A group-project I had for school.
          An altenative site for a customer the school offered us to develop a website for.
          This is for a kind of global library for doctors.
          The site isn't live and is purely a proof of concept.

          One of my internship workplaces as part of my education was with 
          the consulting company, The Council, where I helped to digitize the courses
          they offered.
